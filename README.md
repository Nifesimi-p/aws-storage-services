## üìå Objectives

1. Create an S3 bucket
2. Upload, retrieve, and delete objects
3. Configure public access permissions
4. Host a static website using S3
5. Manage all operations using the AWS CLI
6. Document the process with commands, outputs, and screenshots

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- AWS CLI
- Git & GitHub
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- HTML (static files)

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket preciousnife --region us-east-1
```

---

### 2. Upload Objects to the Bucket

```bash
aws s3 cp index.html s3://preciousnife/
aws s3 cp about.html s3://preciousnife/
```

---

### 3. Retrieve Objects

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://preciousnife/index.html .
```

---

### 4. Delete Objects (if needed)

```bash
aws s3 rm s3://preciousnife/about.html
```

---

### 5. Enable Static Website Hosting

```bash
aws s3 website s3://preciousnife/ --index-document index.html
```

---

### 6. Configure Public Access Settings

#### Disable Block Public Access:

```bash
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
  --bucket preciousnife \
  --public-access-block-configuration '{"BlockPublicAcls":false,"IgnorePublicAcls":false,"BlockPublicPolicy":false,"RestrictPublicBuckets":false}'
```

#### Attach a Public Bucket Policy:

**bucket-policy.json**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::preciousnife/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Apply the policy:**
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket preciousnife --policy file://bucket-policy.json
```

---

### 7. Access the Website

The static website is now publicly available at:

```bash
http://preciousnife.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

## üßæ Notes

- Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the appropriate IAM user credentials.
